# 🏆 SIH Winning Project: Employment Department Smart Chatbot

This **Smart Chatbot** is a winning project of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023**, developed to enhance the user experience on the **PGRKAM** platform. The chatbot provides multilingual support (Punjabi, English, Hindi) and answers queries about job search, skill development, foreign counseling, and more—all while offering personalized job recommendations.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Employment Department** currently offers digital services via the [PGRKAM portal](http://www.pgrkam.com) and its mobile application. However, navigating through multiple modules (such as private sector jobs, government jobs, self-employment avenues, foreign jobs, etc.) is complex for users.

As the **SIH 2023** winning solution, we designed a **smart digital assistant** using **GPT-3** to help users seamlessly interact with the platform. It reduces time and effort while navigating and provides personalized recommendations.
